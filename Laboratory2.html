    Many people use the terms <strong>Internet</strong> and the <strong>World Wide Web</strong> interchangeably,<br/>
    but in fact, the two terms are not synonymous. The Internet and the Web are two<br/>
    separated but related things.<br/>
    <br/>
    The <strong>Internet</strong> is a massive networks of networks, a networking infrastructure. It<br/>
    connects millions of computers together globally, forming a network in which<br/>
    any computer can communicate with other computers as long as they are both<br/>
    connected in the internet. Information can travel via the internet via a variety of<br/>
    language called <em>"Protocols"</em>.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The <strong>World Wide Web</strong> or simply <em>"Web"</em>, is a way of accessing information over<br/>
    the medium of the internet. It is an information-sharing model that is built on top<br/>
    of the internet. The Web uses the <strong>HTTP protocol</strong>, only one of the languages<br/>
    over the internet, to transmit data.
